<h1>icu5e</h1>

A module for <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">FoundryVTT</a> that lets you draw fog of war manually.

<h2>Features</h2>
Adds an icon in the token hud (right-click the token). When clicked on the controlled token, it will reveal any hidden enemy within X units if the Passive Perception of the controlled token is greater than the Passive Stealth of the Hostile token. The number of units can be edited within the Module Settings window.

<h2>Planned Future Features</h2>

Version 1.2.0 - Version 1.0.0 only works with one token at a time. I want to allow for multiple controlled tokens, using the token with the highest passive perception regardless of how many tokens are selected. I also want to make it so only the GM has access to use the button.

Version 1.3.0 - I want to give the GM the option to have players roll rather than use the Passive Perception. The idea is to have the GM be able to use the characters passive perception or prompt the user to roll a perception check.

Version 1.4.0 - The hidden token will have their Passive Stealth as a default value but the GM will be able to override the value with something of their own choosing. This is useful for DM's like me who roll a stealth roll for each monster when prepping a scene.

Version 1.5.0 - I want to account for walls being in the way but maybe ignore terrain and invisible walls? Also, I'd like to limit the token hud interface to only player Actors and not NPCs or monsters.
